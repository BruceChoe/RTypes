# Assignment spec (filtered down)

**Update to be made by Friday, April 22nd**

By the initial due date, set up an initial website for your CS 426 Senior Project. **As the project progresses, you are required to update the website with new material, e.g., additional related project resources, useful links, news on project progress, and some of your project’s deliverables (poster and video).**

At this point in time, the following should be provided on your project website:

* ~~Project title, with the specification that this is a CS 426 Senior Project in Computer Science, Spring 2022, at UNR, CSE Department~~
* ~~Team number, name (if you decide to use one) & team member(s)~~
* ~~Instructors & external advisor(s) with their affiliation(s)~~
* ~~Short project description (recommended size: between 200 and 400 words)~~
* ~~Project related resources:~~
  * ~~Problem domain book~~
  * ~~Websites useful/related to your project~~
  * ~~Technical reports, conference papers, and/or journal articles~~
  * ~~News and other information pertaining to your project topic or components (e.g., technology, hardware, etc.)~~
  * To the above, you can **add other relevant information or related material** that you think will enhance your project’s online presentation.
    * *We kinda already have this, but I think linking to the datasets on Dr. Nguyen's lab website would be a good addition as well.*

~~Note that while the website could be fairly simple, it should still have good, rich-enough contents and a good appearance.~~ *Looks good to me.*

~~If your project is a website or web-based product, you can use an “About” page to house this information.~~ *No thanks, I'm not hosting this dogshit!*

Please note that all project websites **will be made public** through a CS 426 web page accessible outside Web Campus, so avoid posting private information or material that may breach an existing NDA.
