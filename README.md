## Notes for the Instructors

The contents of this file are the same as the contents of `README.txt`.

This project uses [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/), a JavaScript web framework.
As a result, the project files contain lots of boilerplate and system files.
The files and directories that may be of interest to the instructors are:
* `client/`
  * `main.html` is the page shown in the demo that demonstrates the functionality of the project.
  * `main.js` contains the front-end JavaScript code
* `imports/api/methods.js`
* The R scripts in `scripts/`
* The test dataset `scripts/KIRC.RData`
* `test.py`

`public/` is a directory that Meteor searches for HTML image embedding
as well as where we direct our uploaded files.
