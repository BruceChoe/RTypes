## Notes for the Instructors

This project uses [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/), a JavaScript web framework.
As a result, the project files contain lots of boilerplate and system files.
Directories that may be ignored are as follows:
* `.meteor/`
* `node_modules/` (generated by meteor)
* `public/`
* `temp/` (generated by the application)
* `users/` (generated by the application)

`reference/` is a directory that contains database schemas.
These hold no weight in the program, they were just used for internal reference.
